            "title": "Cumin-Scented Squash and Lentil Soup with Crispy Chickpeas",
            "description": "A delicious soup does not need to take hours over the stove.  Red lentils cook quickly, and if you roast the squash ahead of time, everything can be bowled up in under an hour.  My favorites tool, the immersion blender, is used here, and it makes craemy soups a breeze.  I highly recommend investing in one for your cooking essentials. ",

This dish is a dairy-free spin on the old Staley family recipe.  What makes this version great, in my opinion, is the richness of the mushroom sauce paired with crispy-skinned and perfectly seasoned chicken.  This dish always feels like the perfect comfort food when the weather starts to cool off in the fall.",
